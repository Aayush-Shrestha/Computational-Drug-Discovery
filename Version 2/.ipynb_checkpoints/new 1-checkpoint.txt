Molecular Weight (MolWt):
	Definition: The sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in a molecule.
	Use: Provides information about the mass of the molecule, which is important for various applications, including drug design.

LogP (Partition Coefficient):
	Definition: The logarithm of the partition coefficient, which measures the distribution of a compound between a hydrophobic and a 	hydrophilic phase.
	Use: Indicates the compound's lipophilicity, which is crucial for predicting its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 	(ADME) properties.

Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors (NumHDonors):
	Definition: The count of hydrogen atoms that are potential donors of hydrogen bonds.
	Use: Reflects the ability of the molecule to donate hydrogen bonds, which is relevant for interactions with biological targets.

Number of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (NumHAcceptors):
	Definition: The count of atoms that can act as acceptors of hydrogen bonds.
	Use: Indicates the molecule's capacity to form hydrogen bonds, which is significant for interactions with other molecules, particularly 	in biological systems.

Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA):
	Definition: The surface area of a molecule's polar atoms, excluding contributions from hydrogens.
	Use: Reflects the molecule's ability to participate in polar interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. Important for understanding 	interactions with biological targets.

Number of Rotatable Bonds (NumRotatableBonds):
	Definition: The count of bonds that allow free rotation around them.
	Use: Indicates the molecular flexibility. Molecules with a higher number of rotatable bonds may have greater conformational flexibility, 	which can affect their biological activity.

Number of Rings (RingCount):
	Definition: The count of rings in the molecular structure.
	Use: Reflects the structural complexity of the molecule. Some biological activities are influenced by the presence and type of rings in 	a molecule.

Fraction of sp3 Hybridized Carbons (FractionCSP3):
	Definition: The fraction of carbons in the molecule that are sp3 hybridized.
	Use: Provides information about the stereochemistry and hybridization state of carbon atoms. Relevant for understanding the 3D structure 	and properties of the molecule.

Number of Violations of Lipinski's Rule of Five (NumViolationsLipinski):
	Definition: Counts the number of Lipinski's Rule of Five violations.
	Use: Lipinski's Rule of Five is a set of criteria used to assess the drug-likeness of a molecule. It evaluates properties related to 	molecular weight, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bonding. This descriptor counts how many of these criteria are violated.

Number of Nitrogen-Oxygen Bonds (NOCount):
	Definition: Counts the number of nitrogen-oxygen bonds in the molecule.
	Use: Provides information about the presence of specific functional groups, such as nitro groups, which may influence the molecule's 	biological activity.

Number of Aromatic Rings (NumAromaticRings):
	Definition: Counts the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
	Use: Indicates the presence of aromatic systems in the molecule, which can be important for interactions with biological targets.

Aromatic Proportion (AromaticProportion):
	Definition: The ratio of the number of aromatic atoms to the total number of heavy atoms.
	Use: Provides a measure of the aromatic character of the molecule, which can be relevant for understanding its electronic structure and 	reactivity.
